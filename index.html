  <h2>Journal Entry 1</h2>
  <h4>Week Of Sept. 24th-30th:</h4>
    <p>This week was a crash course in CSS properties. I taught myself the Animation property. If wasn't as difficult as I had thought it would be. So basically the animation property allows an element on your webpage to move across the screen. When first seeing the example it seemed like the code for writing it would be quite daunting. Turned out to be a decent amount of code, but nothing too crazy. The hardest part was making sure the keyframes portion was set correctly. I had tried using pixels at first, but once I changed it to % it worked. I then started playing around with the colors and figured out that I could change the color of what I was moving on my page based upon where on the page it was as it moved. This is the CSS property that I chose to present to the class. Other properties that were learned included word wrap, working more indepth with gradients, and the overflow-y property.
  <p>Learning those CSS properties was cool, but not nearly the best part of the week. We had a guest speaker from Automattic come in and talk to our class. He went over his rise in the industry and where he is at now. It was very interesting listening to the perspective of someone currently woring in the industry. He described a normal workday and the pros and cons of working in development. Overall the talk was very informative and further reassured my feeling of choosing software development for my future career.</p>

  <h2>Journal Entry 2</h2>
  <h4>Week of Oct. 1st-7th:</h4>
    <p>Much of this week was spent on learning how to make my websites responsive. I was introduced to the CSS property media queries. I'd say this was by far the hardest thing I have run into so far in terms of what I have learned in HTML and CSS. I started of by just creating divs that I gave a height and width to creating a box with a colored background. Then used the media property to adjust the boxes colors when the display screen became smaller. This part was pretty easy, which gave me a slight bit of false confidence moving forward with the property. I messed around with the boxes a little more and began making the size of them flow with the display screen along with the color change. Next, I moved on to using a previously created HTML/CSS webpage and making that responsive. This is where things went slightly downhill. I thought I would just and divs around certain sections and then follow the same method as I did with the boxes. I quickly learned it was that simple. I refershed my page and made the display screen smaller and everything basically broke. I had text and headings not lining up at all, some text was overlapping others, some areas just didnt respond at all. So, basically a disater. I found that using float was causing some of the trouble and began ripping out things that seemed to be breaking it when making it responsive to the screen change. I also then ripped of the div boxes i created around the content. With further tweaking and a lot of head scratching, I found that I could just target existing classes and change them within the media query. Once I found this out things became much more clear and made a lot more sense. I have since been using this week to further my understanding of responsive web design.
  </p>
  <p> Also, during this week we had a guest speaker come into class. It was very informative in terms of breaking into the industry and finding a job once I have finished my schooling. I learned what a normal work day usually consists of and just how certain workflow methodologies are used in a professional work setting.</p>

  <h2>Journal Entry 3</h2>
  <h4>Week of Oct. 8th-14th:</h4>
  <p>This week was spent mostly learning sass, which stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. It is used with your CSS file to better compile your code. This feature was something that seemed difficult to master and I by no means have come close to mastering this yet. I did a few of the lessons on code acadamey, but this only add to my confusion. It seemed like when implementing the code in the scss file what was showing up on the CSS file made it less readable. I do really like how you can nest elements and this does make it easier for changes, but I'm still trying to get ahold on the new way of writing the code and making sure im properly nesting and applying the correct style to my webpage. I realized just like basically everything in development that it will take constant repetition to fully understand sass. I definiatly believe that once I'm able to properly use sass it will make writing my CSS much easier, especially when trying to make fixes to the webpage.
  </p>
  <p>I have began working on a new website. It consists of 4 webpages and will be responsive in desktop and mobile. I have created all the HTML structures for each webpage and will start on styling the pages with sass/css. I'm creating the mobile version first, because I believe this is the most efficient way when writing the code. I will then use media query to create the desktop version.</p>

  <h2>Journal Entry 4</h2>
  <h4>Week of Oct. 15th-21st</h4>
  <p>During this week I have gotten more familar with sass and its features. I have been implementing sass into my current midterm project. I have created muiltiple sass files that all get imported into a css file. I created sass files for the header, the hero section which I have named title-image, and homepage content. I'm starting to get the idea more of sass and how it could be easier down the road to break up components of a webpage to make it easier for changes and organization. We have been utilizing code reviews on Git Hub within our groups of 4. This has been helpful in noticing small mistakes within my code and making corrections faster and easier. I have finished styling my website and completed the meadia qeuries as well. The hardest part was picking on on media queries, but once I understood how the code syntax works it came to me pretty quickly.</p>

  <h2>Journal Entry 5</h2>
  <h4>Week of Oct. 22nd-28th</h4>
  <p>During this week we were introduced to javascript and it is by far the hardest thing we have been taught so far. I did a lesson on code academy for it but it didn't quite stick with me. We were introduced into the data types that we will be using this semester, they are boolean, null, undefined, number, string, symbol(which we will not be using), and object. Javascript compared to HTML and CSS is much more logic based and the syntax is completely different. We have started off by log functions into the console. I can tell this will take me some time to get a handle on. We were also assigned a new project an alternate design for the CPOSC website. For this project we will be working in a group of two, but also doing code reviews in a group of 4. This project will go more indepth with sass and will utilize some javascript.</p>

  <h2>Journal Entry 6</h2>
  <h4>Week of Oct. 29th - Nov. 4th</h4>
  <p>This week consisted of more and more javascript. I'm still struggling with picking this language up as quickly as I would like, but i can't expect everything to just come easy with each new language I learn. We got more into functions, loops, and arrays, again using the console log. I also made good progress on my current project the CPOSC website. All HTML structure is done and have started working on the mobile version of the site. This is the first project we will be using a single repository between two people. At first we didn't understand how we could both be working on the same repo, but that turned out to not be as difficult as we had originally thought. Still of course ran into some merge conflicts, but we are ironing those out. I also gave a presentation on technology in baseball, where I talked about different traing techniques and other technologies the MLB uses to enhance fan experience in the ballpark and on TV.</p>

  <h2>Journal Entry 7</h2>
  <h4>Week of Nov. 5th-11th</h4>
  <p>During this week we continued to work on our CPOSC projects. My group has finished all the styling for the mobile version of the website and we have begun working on the media query for the desktop version. We have run into some issues when translating to the desktop version, but we have good cummunication and have utilized pair programming on some of the issues. Again javascript was a pretty big focal point of the week, as I am slightly getting more comfortable with it. We started psuedo coding to try and make things easier when writing javascript code. This has been somewhat of a help as I see the process that needs to be taken for the code to run. The hardest part for me is learing all the different properties and how best to write the code.</p>

  <h2>Journal Entry 8</h2>
  <h4>Week of Nov. 12th-18th</h4>
  <p>This week was focused on finishing our projects. I wrote javascript code for the accordian sections in 1 of the webpages that are within our website. This took me by far the longest of any part of my project to complete. Lets just say I spent a good bit of time on google. Once that was finished me and my partner worked on the finishing the navigation menu that we had put off until the end. We then did some cross-browser testing and final changes/fixes before submitting our project. Also, right when we got done with this project we were introduced to another project which will take up the last weeks of the semester to complete. We will be working in groups of 3 and will be utilizing all knowledge that was introduced to us this semester while working with a scrum methodology.</p>
