  <h2>Journal Entry 1</h2>
  <p>Week Of Sept. 24th-30th:<br>This week was a crash course in CSS properties. I taught myself the Animation property. If wasn't as difficult as I had thought it would be. So basically the animation property allows an element on your webpage to move across the screen. When first seeing the example it seemed like the code for writing it would be quite daunting. Turned out to be a decent amount of code, but nothing too crazy. The hardest part was making sure the keyframes portion was set correctly. I had tried using pixels at first, but once I changed it to % it worked. I then started playing around with the colors and figured out that I could change the color of what I was moving on my page based upon where on the page it was as it moved. This is the CSS property that I chose to present to the class. Other properties that were learned included word wrap, working more indepth with gradients, and the overflow-y property.</p>
  <p>Learning those CSS properties was cool, but not nearly the best part of the week. We had a guest speaker from Automattic come in and talk to our class. He went over his rise in the industry and where he is at now. It was very interesting listening to the perspective of someone currently woring in the industry. He described a normal workday and the pros and cons of working in development. Overall the talk was very informative and further reassured my feeling of choosing software development for my future career.</p>
