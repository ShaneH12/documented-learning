  <h2>Journal Entry 1</h2>
  <p>Week Of Sept. 24th-30th:<br>This week was a crash course in CSS properties. I taught myself the Animation property. If wasn't as difficult as I had thought it would be. So basically the animation property allows an element on your webpage to move across the screen. When first seeing the example it seemed like the code for writing it would be quite daunting. Turned out to be a decent amount of code, but nothing too crazy. The hardest part was making sure the keyframes portion was set correctly. I had tried using pixels at first, but once I changed it to % it worked. I then started playing around with the colors and figured out that I could change the color of what I was moving on my page based upon where on the page it was as it moved. This is the CSS property that I chose to present to the class. Other properties that were learned included word wrap, working more indepth with gradients, and the overflow-y property.
  <p>Learning those CSS properties was cool, but not nearly the best part of the week. We had a guest speaker from Automattic come in and talk to our class. He went over his rise in the industry and where he is at now. It was very interesting listening to the perspective of someone currently woring in the industry. He described a normal workday and the pros and cons of working in development. Overall the talk was very informative and further reassured my feeling of choosing software development for my future career.</p>

  <h2>Journal Entry 2</h2>
  <p>Week of Oct. 1st-7th<br>Much of this week was spent on learning how to make my websites responsive. I was introduced to the CSS property media queries. I'd say this was by far the hardest thing I have run into so far in terms of what I have learned in HTML and CSS. I started of by just creating divs that I gave a height and width to creating a box with a colored background. Then used the media property to adjust the boxes colors when the display screen became smaller. This part was pretty easy, which gave me a slight bit of false confidence moving forward with the property. I messed around with the boxes a little more and began making the size of them flow with the display screen along with the color change. Next, I moved on to using a previously created HTML/CSS webpage and making that responsive. This is where things went slightly downhill. I thought I would just and divs around certain sections and then follow the same method as I did with the boxes. I quickly learned it was that simple. I refershed my page and made the display screen smaller and everything basically broke. I had text and headings not lining up at all, some text was overlapping others, some areas just didnt respond at all. So, basically a disater. I found that using float was causing some of the trouble and began ripping out things that seemed to be breaking it when making it responsive to the screen change. I also then ripped of the div boxes i created around the content. With further tweaking and a lot of head scratching, I found that I could just target existing classes and change them within the media query. Once I found this out things became much more clear and made a lot more sense. I have since been using this week to further my understanding of responsive web design.</p>
  <p> Also, during this week we had a guest speaker come into class. It was very informative in terms of breaking into the industry and finding a job once I have finished my schooling. I learned what a normal work day usually consists of and just how certain workflow methodologies are used in a professional work setting.</p>
